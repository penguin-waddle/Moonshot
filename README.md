## Features
- **Detailed Astronaut Profiles**: Learn about astronauts with detailed biographies and images.
- **Space Mission Overviews**: Access comprehensive information on different space missions, including launch dates and mission highlights.
- **Interactive Layouts**: Switch between grid and list layouts for viewing missions.
- **Crew Information**: Explore the crew members of each mission and their specific roles.

## Technical Aspects
- **SwiftUI Views**: Utilized various SwiftUI views like `ScrollView`, `VStack`, `NavigationView`, and `GeometryReader`.
- **Custom Modifiers**: Implemented custom view modifiers for consistent styling across the app.
- **Data Decoding**: Used `JSONDecoder` with custom date formatting to parse and display data from local JSON files.
- **Navigation and Accessibility**: Integrated `NavigationLink` for detailed views and enhanced accessibility features.

## Learning Insights
- **GeometryReader**: Gained proficiency in using GeometryReader for responsive layout designs.
- **Custom Data Models**: Created and worked with custom data models (`Astronaut` and `Mission`) to handle complex data structures.
- **JSON Parsing**: Enhanced skills in parsing local JSON data and handling dates with custom formats.
- **SwiftUI Navigation**: Mastered SwiftUI's navigation patterns, including passing data between views.

## Project Experience
Building Moonshot provided an excellent opportunity to delve into more complex SwiftUI concepts and data handling. It was an enriching experience to learn about space missions and astronauts while developing an app that brings this information to life.
